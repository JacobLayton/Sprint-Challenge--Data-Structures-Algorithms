**Exercise 2**

I would first drop an egg from 1/2 _n_. If it breaks I would move half way between 1/2 _n_ and the ground floor, if it reamined unbroken I would move to half way between 1/2 _n_ and the top floor. I would continue this process of dividing the remaining section of floors until I found _f_. Anytime the division came out to a decimal I would round up.
